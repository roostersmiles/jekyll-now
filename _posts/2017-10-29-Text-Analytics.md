## Initial Reflections on Text Analytics

At work I use text-analytics for large qualitative data sets in order to understand major themes. I do not often have the chance to review at a top level the overall application of these tools outside of their use to identify topics discussed. 

Text-analytics is a tool to allow us to identify concepts within large text-based corpus. The distant reading doesn't capture alot of the detail but provides a sense of the overall ideas and extent of the convergence of ideas across documents. The volume of themes is often reflected in a quantified analysis, using counts or percentages to describe the differences. Often cases it lends more credibility to the analysis than necessary and the loss of narrative-based or qualitative notes. 

As with any research tool, it is important to ensure that the analysis will be useful to draw conclusions, meet the objectives of the study and work approriately with the type of data being provided. Different TA tools will have different benefits and drawbacks and there is a need to identify these in the presentation of findings. There needs to be a standard approach to sharing the details of the TA methodology and process, report details of the source of the data and how the tool operates. This promotes the transparency of the process and ensures replicability of the analysis.

Sentiment analysis for example uses a dictonary approach to identifying postive, negative and neutral sentiment within text. It can be done at a word level, sentance level or full document level.

I am certain as I continue to explore this topic and through our in-class discussions.
